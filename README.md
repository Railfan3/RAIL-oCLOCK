🚆 RAIL'oCLOCK
RAIL'oCLOCK is a lightweight offline desktop application that displays Indian railway timetables, platform numbers, and source-to-destination train routes. It is designed to work without any internet connection using preloaded JSON data, making it fast and efficient.

⚠️ Note: This application supports a limited number of specific stations only, as real-time government APIs are not accessible. Data is manually compiled and stored in local JSON files.

🧠 Features
🔍 Station Lookup: Enter a station name or code to view trains stopping at that station.

🗓️ Detailed Timetables: Arrival and departure timings along with platform numbers.

🛤️ Complete Routes: Displays all intermediate stations between the source and destination.

📁 Offline Functionality: Works entirely offline with local JSON data.

🖥️ Simple GUI: Built with Python's Tkinter for a clean and responsive user experience.

🛠️ Windows Executable: Ready-to-use .exe file – no setup required.

📌 Important Notes
This app only supports selected stations included in the stations.json file.

Due to the unavailability of public Indian Railways APIs, the app cannot fetch or update real-time data.

You can expand the app by adding more station or train timetable JSON files in the data/ directory.

🔮 Future Plans
Live API integration (if access becomes available)

Real-time train status

Multi-station bulk search

Cross-platform (Linux/Mac) version
